# Flame Game 1/9/18


#### This a game built with Behavior Driven Development techniques, and tamagotchi-style setInterval/timeOut functions. The flame grows at a steady pace, and the user can either douse it with water or throw a match on it to alter the growth status of the flame. If the flame reaches a status of 100 points, the user 'loses'.
